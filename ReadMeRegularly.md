You do not need all 3000+ LeetCode problems. Many successful candidates for Google/AWS/Meta clear interviews after roughly 150–300 well‑chosen problems, with most of them at medium difficulty.[1][2][3]

## How many problems (rough targets)

For a backend SDE role at big companies, a realistic target is:  
- Around 150–250 problems total if you practice smart, not randomly.[2][3][1]
- Within that, focus on:  
  - ~50–70 Easy (to warm up and fix basic mistakes).[1][2]
  - ~80–150 Medium (these are the core of interviews at Google/Amazon/Meta).[4][2][1]
  - ~10–30 Hard (only after mediums feel comfortable, for confidence with tricky questions).[2][1]

Plenty of people report clearing Google/Amazon after roughly 120–180 questions, mainly medium/hard, once they understood patterns and reviewed their mistakes well.[3][1][2]

## Which problems to choose

Instead of random LeetCode grinding, use focused lists plus topic coverage:  
- Start with a small “must‑do” list like Blind 75 / similar curated sets to cover core patterns.[5][2]
- Then extend with company‑tagged sets for Amazon/Google/Meta (array, string, tree/graph, DP, binary search, hashing).[6][4]
- Make sure you see multiple problems for each key pattern (two‑pointers, sliding window, BFS/DFS, prefix sums, etc.), not just one.[4][2]

## What “prepared” should mean (beyond count)

The raw number matters less than how you solve:  
- You can explain your approach, time/space, and trade‑offs clearly for most medium questions.[4][2]
- You can solve unseen problems in 30–40 minutes by mapping them to known patterns rather than memorized solutions.[1][2]
- You know core backend/data‑structure topics well: arrays, strings, hash maps, linked lists, trees/graphs, heaps, basic DP, and complexity analysis.[4]

## Backend‑specific preparation

In parallel with LeetCode, for backend SDE you also need:  
- Strong coding in your main language (Java/C++/Go/Python): clean code, testing, error handling.[4]
- System design basics: APIs, databases, caching, scaling, consistency, queues, etc., because senior and even many mid‑level backend rounds test this.[7][4]

If you tell roughly how many problems you’ve already done and your comfort level with mediums, a more personalized target (for example “you need ~X more problems over Y months”) can be estimated.
